Getting Started 


Windows PC users:

You will need to use PuTTY or Bitvise SSH Client to connect to our UNIX server (129.106.2.94) for all online computer lab sessions. Both can be downloaded from https://www.putty.org/.

You will need to use WinSCP (https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) or Bitvise SFTP to transfer files between your computer and our UNIX server.



Mac users:

You will need to use Terminal to connect to our UNIX server (129.106.2.94) for all online computer lab sessions.

Login: 
ssh username@ 129.106.2.94

Copy a file from your computer to the server: 
scp your_local_folder/filename username@ 129.106.2.94:/home/username/

Copy a file from the server to your computer:
scp username@ 129.106.2.94:/home/username/filename your_local_folder

Set working directory
setwd("/home/PH2780L/your account name/Lab1/") ## set working directory
getwd() ## get working directory

Import data
# read.table(file, header = FALSE, sep = "", quote = "\"'",…)
# read.csv(file, header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\"",
         dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "", …)

?read.table  ## show the help document of read.table

geno <- read.table("/home/("/home/PH2780L/public/Lab1/geno.txt", header=T, sep="\t")

Merge data
# merge(x, y, by = intersect(names(x), names(y)),
      by.x = by, by.y = by, all = FALSE, all.x = all, all.y = all, sort = TRUE, …)

?merge  ## show the help document of merge
pheno.geno <- merge(pheno, geno, by="id", all=T, sort=T)

Data summary
dim(pheno) ## check the dimension of a data frame
dim(geno)
summary(pheno.geno$age) ## for continuous variables
table(pheno.geno$smoking) ## for categorical variables

Export data
# write.table(x, file = "", quote = TRUE, sep = " ", na = "NA", row.names = TRUE, col.names = TRUE, …)

write.table(pheno.geno, file="phenogeno.txt", row.names = F, col.names = T, sep = "\t", quote = F)
