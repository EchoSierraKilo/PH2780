1704 (of 1704) markers to be included from [ lab4clean.map ]
1000 individuals read from [ lab4clean.ped ] 
1000 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 1000 controls and 0 missing
623 males, 377 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading alternate phenotype from [ hdl.pheno ] 
1000 individuals with non-missing alternate phenotype
Assuming a quantitative trait
Missing phenotype value is -9
Reading 2 covariates from [ hdl.covar ] with nonmissing values for 1000 individuals
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1704 SNPs
1000 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.994193
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1704 SNPs
After filtering, 1000 individuals with non-missing status
After filtering, 623 males, 377 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Converting data to Individual-major format
Writing linear model association results to [ hdl.assoc.linear ]
