1940 (of 1940) markers to be included from [ lab4.map ]
1000 individuals read from [ lab4.ped ] 
1000 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 1000 controls and 0 missing
623 males, 377 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1940 SNPs
1000 founders and 0 non-founders found
Writing Hardy-Weinberg tests (founders-only) to [ lab4_hardy.hwe ] 
8 markers to be excluded based on HWE test ( p <= 0.001 )
	0 markers failed HWE test in cases
	8 markers failed HWE test in controls
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.993726
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1932 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 1000 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 623 males, 377 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
